static KUAI = 'The instrumental post-rock band KUAI was formed in Reykjavik, Iceland, in the summer of 1998.\nThey released the album kuai in 2001 that the band and Elmar Þór Gilbertsson recorded and mixed.\nThe band played on various venues in Reykjavik where the largest one was playing before the band Blonde Redhead in Laugardalshöll at Reykjavik Mini-festival in 2001.\nIn an interview around that time the band members were asked to explain their music in words and their response was "it\'s instrumental rock, maybe a bit experimental at times, and at other times the band would plow into rock and heavy metal, where all the member\'s music roots stem from, and here and there sprinkled lightly with subtle jazz influence."\n\nThe songs on the album kuai were recorded by playing them as performing "live", instead of the usual method of recording each instrument one at a time.\nAdditional guitar parts were overdubbed afterwards among other instruments.\nEgill played organ and piano, Guðmundur arranged the cello parts that Hallgrímur Jónas Jensson and Rannveig Bjarnadóttir played.\nSteinar Sigurðsson played saxaphone on Andefni.\nThe band and Elmar Þór Gilbertsson recorded and mixed all the songs from September 2000 to June 2001 except the song Rover, which was recorded and mixed by Jón Elvar Hafsteinsson in 1999.\nThe album was mastered by Bjarni Bragi.'
