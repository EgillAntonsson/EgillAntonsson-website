I was born in 1982 and raised in Reykjavik, Iceland. Since 2014 I live in Sweden with my wonderful wife Jantra Phosri, daughter Soffía Rós Egilsdóttir and son Andri Reyr Ragnarsson.<br>
</p>
<p>
I'm son of Anton Angantýsson (that's what my last name literally means) and Halla Soffía Jónasdóttir, and brother to Jónas B. Antonsson. Our two older brothers and namesakes passed away before I was born. They played music and painted pictures and according to family and friends were good boys. I digitalized their music that they recorded on a cassette in the early 1970s that you can listen to <a href="/music/pesi-year-1974">here</a>.
