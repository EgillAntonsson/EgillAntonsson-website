<h2>My workshop</h2>
<p>
	I recently decided to do a short workshop about TDD at <a href="https://www.maginteractive.com">work</a><br>
	and for preparation I browsed the internet looking for a fitting assignment,<br>
	and I came across <a href="http://infalliblecode.com/unity-tdd-1/">TDD in Unity - Part 1 post, by Charles Amat</a>,<br>
	where he sets up his assignment: to implement the <i>Life Gauge</i> from <i>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> game.<br>
	<br>
	I thought this assignment was a good and fitting for the workshop,<br>
	 thus I read the <a href='https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Life_Gauge'>Life Gauge description on Zelda Wiki</a> (which was linked in the 'Part 1' post),<br>
	and also played the game a bit, focusing on the Life Gauge.<br>
	But I did not go through the 'TDD in Unity' series, as I was running out of preparation time.<br>
	<br>
	My task order in both my preparations and workshop walk-through:<br>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Write down the <i>Life Gauge</i> behavior from the user perspective<br>
		(based on the wiki, and to a lesser degree my experience, as I'm not so good in <i>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>)</li>
	<li>Break it down and filter into a list of requirements for the developer perspective</li>
	<li>Focus first on the (non visual) domain logic and implement all the requirements it should fulfill,<br>
		as TDD can fully and easily be applied on the domain layer.</li>
	<li>Afterwards the focus would shift to the visuals,<br>
		where the value of TDD potentially would dwindle the closer I got to the physical boundary of the screen.<br>
		(<a href="https://egill.rocks/blog/tdd-health/part1">Boundary layers</a> section in 'Part 1' elaborates on this).</li>
</ol>
<p>
	With this I held the short workshop where I screen shared TDD-ing the implementation,<br>
	and I and the participants collaboratively completed some of the domain logic requirements,<br>
	when the bell rang and the time was up.<br>
</p>

<h2>Comparing approaches of the assignment</h2>
<p>
	After the workshop I was curious how Charles Amat solved it,<br>
	thus I watched on YouTube the whole <a href="http://infalliblecode.com/unity-tdd-2/">TDD in Unity</a> series.<br>
	I both enjoyed it and learned from watching Charles Amat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding">live coding</a> and implementing the <i>Life Gauge</i><br>
	and his end result solution is good and sound, and I thank Charles for his work.<br>
	but I noticed that his focus and task order quite differed from mine, as he:<br>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Starts planning how he would go about creating the heart container in Unity, from a graphical UI perspective</li>
	<li>Starts TDD-ing logic close to the graphical UI</li>
	<li>Ends with TDD-ing the domain logic, the Player Health in <a href="http://infalliblecode.com/unity-tdd-7/">Part 7</a> and <a href="http://infalliblecode.com/unity-tdd-8/">Part 8</a><br>
		The requirements on the domain logic are very simple<br>
		and are far from covering all the health requirements of <i>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i><br>
		<span class="outOfScope">After re-reading the 'Part 1', I acknowledge that Charles does not indicate<br>
			that he'll cover all the requirements, as he wrote:<br>
			<q>The Life Gauge depletes when damage is taken and replenishes when health regenerating items are consumed. Besides some animations and effects, thatâ€™s all there is to it; the requirements for the Life Gauge are pretty straightforward.</q></span>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>TDD-ing the same assignment, but with my focus and task order</h3>
<p>
	This is why I wanted to do a blog post series with the same assignment:<br>
	implement Avatar Health, based on <i>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>,<br>
	but with my focus and task order (see my ordered bulletin list above in <i>Workshop</i> section).<br>
	<br>
	When focusing on the domain logic, there will mainly be .NET code and not much usage of the Unity editor<br>
	(though I run the tests via Unity Test Runner),<br>
	When the focus later goes to the visuals, then there will be some Unity visual specific code,<br> and object / component configuring via the Unity editor.<br>
	The visual implementation part will likely be similar to the <a href="http://infalliblecode.com/unity-tdd-1/">TDD in Unity series</a>,<br>
	thus I might decide to reference it heavily, instead of reinventing the wheel for that part.<br>
	<br>
	My format will also differ, as I will go through RED / GREEN / REFACTOR cycles<br>
	and display the code classes (fully or partially) directly in the blog posts,<br>
	and not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding">live coding</a> it (I might re-evaluate the format later).<br>
	With this approach I filter the smallest 'back and forth' steps away,<br>
	with the ambition that the code and my reasoning about it reads like soothing poetry of red green rhythmic loops.
</p>

<h3>The Life Gauge behavior from the user perspective</h3>
<p>
	The below list is based on the <a href='https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Life_Gauge'>Life Gauge description on Zelda Wiki</a>:<br>
</p>
<ul>
	<li class="noBulletinPoint"><b>Definition and start state:</b></li>
	<li>The Life Gauge measures Link's current amount of health</li>
	<li>Health is visually represented in the form of Hearts, and they are in fractions of four</li>
	<li>The Life Gauge starts with 3 Hearts</li>
	<br>
	<li class="noBulletinPoint"><b>Taking damage and dying:</b></li>
	<li>Whenever Link (the avatar) takes damage, he will lose a certain amount of Heart fractions equal to the damage taken.<br>
		When Link loses all of his Hearts, the game ends.</li>
	<li>Link will take at least a quarter of a Heart of damage from any attack</li>
	<li>Some enemies may do more damage in one hit than Link has health.<br>
		As long as Link's Life Gauge is full, he is protected from any attack that would instantly kill him,<br>
		and will instead be left alive with a quarter Heart remaining.<br>
		However, this has limitations: if the damage is more than five Hearts above Link's maximum health, he will still die</li>
	<br>
	<li class="noBulletinPoint"><b>Health Replenishing and maximum:</b></li>
	<li>Link's Life Gauge can be replenished by:<br>
		picking up recovery Hearts,<br>
		drinking recovery Potions<br>
		or by resting while Sitting or Sleeping.
		</li>
	<li>The Life Gauge can be extended to a total of 30 Hearts</li>
	<li>The Life Gauge can be temporarily extended by consuming certain Foods that grant Link yellow temporary Hearts.<br>
		These Hearts are lost when Link takes damage and cannot be recovered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Domain / Visual SoC mapping of <i>Life Gauge</i></h3>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Domain Layer / Model</th>
		<th>Visual Layer / View</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center">
			Avatar Health
		</td>
		<td class="center">
			Heart Container
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center">
				-
		</td>
		<td class="center">
			Heart (contains 4 Fractions)
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center">
			Health Points
		</td>
		<td class="center">
			Heart Fraction
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	This is IMO a very helpful separation of concerns (SoC) mapping:<br>
	Heart Container (with its Hearts and fractions) is a specific visual representation<br>
	of the Avatar Health, the domain.<br>
	<br>
	We want the code dependency to be minimal and one-way,<br>
	The view can depend in some way on the model (but not vice-versa).<br>
	<br>
	The team artist might decide to change the visual representation to a health bar or something else.<br>
<ul>
	<li class="noBulletinPoint">With this separation of concern:</li>
	<li>As the model is not dependent on the View, the Model will be unaffected</li>
	<li>The model code domain logic and naming will be unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I might decide to have more than one visual representations simultaneously to fully illustrate this.<br>
	It is quite common in game UI to have more than one visual representation of the same domain object.
