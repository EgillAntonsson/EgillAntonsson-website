<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	This is the first post in a series of posts where I will implement a chess game in the TDD workflow. Though others have already done something similar (e.g. <a href="https://daedtech.com/tdd-and-modeling-a-chess-game/" target="_blank"><i>TDD and modeling a chess game</i> by <i>Erik Dietrich</i></a>), I'm doing this to craft my TDD workflow and share its values and result with you. The series is a continuation of the series <a href="./blog/tdd-health/part1" target="_blank">TTD-ing Avatar Health in C# and C++</a> where I implemented a health system for an avatar, and thus some explanations will be skipped here as they are already covered in that series.

<h2>The rules</h2>
<p>
	Chess has been played for over a thousand years, and it evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500. The chess rules are known to many and the fundamental rules are:
</p>
<ul class="list inline">
	<li>The game of chess is a two player turn based game where each player controls sixteen pieces on a chessboard</li>
	<li>The board is 8x8 squares, 8 horizontal rows that are called Ranks (and presented as letters from 'a' to 'h'), and 8 vertical columns that are called Files (presented numbers as 1 to 8)</li>
	<li>Each piece has a position in one of the squares and can move to a new position, capturing an opponent piece if in that position</li>
	<li>Each piece type (King, Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Pawn) moves in its unique way</li>
	<li>The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's King</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some upfront design</h2>
<p>
	I'll let the TDD cycle drive the design by taking on the next rule / requirement, one at a time. But I'll now design upfront: identifying a domain model concepts that I foresee will be a key building block.
</p>
<h3>The Position</h3>
<p>
	A <i>Position</i> data structure seems to be at the base of the domain model. The board squares have/are <i>Position(s)</i>, and the pieces have a <i>Position</i> and move into a new <i>Position</i>. To streamline calculations in the domain model the <i>Position</i> will be defined as 0-based <i>Row(s)</i> and <i>Column(s)</i>, although the presentation / view will be 'a' to 'h' Ranks and 1-based Files. I deem it well fitting to define <i>Position</i> as a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/structs#161-general" target="_blank">Struct</a>.</p>
