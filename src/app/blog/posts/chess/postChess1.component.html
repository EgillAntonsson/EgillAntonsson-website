<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	This is the first post in a series of posts where I will implement a chess game in the TDD workflow. Though others have already something similar (e.g. <a href="https://daedtech.com/tdd-and-modeling-a-chess-game/" target="_blank">TDD and modeling a chess game</a>), I'm doing this to practice the TDD workflow and share its values and result with you. The series is a continuation of the series <a href="./blog/tdd-health/part1" target="_blank">TTD-ing Avatar Health in C# and C++</a> where I implemented a health system for an avatar, and thus some explanations and steps will be skipped here as they are already covered in that series.
<h2>Using Unity</h2>
<p>
	I will use <a href="https://unity.com">Unity</a> and its packages  <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.1/manual/index.html" target="_blank">Test Framework</a>, a Unity integration of the <a href="https://nunit.org" target="_blank">NUnit</a> framework, and <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/index.html" target="_blank">Code Coverage</a> analysis tool. Other C# .NET framework could be used instead, but Unity was the handiest for me to use. The whole project is on <a href="https://github.com/EgillAntonsson/tdd-avatar-health-in-unity">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
	I create a new Unity project (3D). Both packages <i>Test Framework</i> and <i>Code Coverage</i> are already installed as they are part of the already installed <i>Engineering</i> feature set. The package <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.1/manual/index.html">doc</a> detail how to setup tests for a project. My project structure starts simple:
</p>
<ul class="list inline">
	<li>Test code: <i>Scripts/Tests/EditMode/[ClassName]Test.cs</i></li>
	<li>Production code: <i>Scripts/Runtime/[ClassName].cs</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
	As the folder structure implies I'll do <i>EditMode</i> tests for the <i>Runtime</i> production code. My main reasons to prefer <i>EditMode</i> (over <i>PlayMode</i>) tests are:
</p>
<ul class="list inline">
	<li>They run faster as there is no PlayMode startup cost (in line with <i>What is a good Unit Test</i> section in <a href="./blog/tdd-health/part1">Part 1</a>)</li>
	<li>Tests for the domain logic should not need the <i>PlayMode</i> test feature to run as <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html">Coroutine</a> to wait or step through frames."</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The doc <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.1/manual/edit-mode-vs-play-mode-tests.html">EditMode vs. PlayMode tests</a> explains the difference further.
</p>

<h2>The rules</h2>
<p>
	Chess has been played for over a thousand years, and it evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500. The chess rules are known to many and the fundamental rules are:
</p>
<ul class="list inline">
	<li>The game of chess is a two player turn based game where each player controls sixteen pieces on a chessboard</li>
	<li>The board is 8x8 squares, 8 horizontal rows that are called Ranks (and presented as letters from 'a' to 'h'), and 8 vertical columns that are called Files (presented numbers as 1 to 8)</li>
	<li>Each piece has a position in one of the squares and can move to a new position, capturing an opponent piece if in that position</li>
	<li>Each piece type (King, Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Pawn) moves in its unique way</li>
	<li>The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's King</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some upfront design</h2>
<p>
	I'll let the TDD cycle drive the design by taking on the next rule / requirement, one at a time. But I'll now design upfront: identifying a domain model concepts that I foresee will be a key building block.
</p>
<h3>The Position</h3>
<p>
	A <i>Position</i> data structure seems to be at the base of the domain model. The board squares have/are <i>Position(s)</i>, and the pieces have a <i>Position</i> and move into a new <i>Position</i>. To streamline calculations in the domain model the <i>Position</i> will be defined as 0-based <i>Row(s)</i> and <i>Column(s)</i>, although the presentation / view will be 'a' to 'h' Ranks and 1-based Files. I deem it well fitting to define <i>Position</i> as a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/structs#161-general" target="_blank">Struct</a>.</p>
