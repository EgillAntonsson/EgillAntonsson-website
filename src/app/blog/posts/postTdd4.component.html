<h2>The first Taking Damage requirement</h2>
<p>
	Let's recap the first requirement under <i>Taking Damage and Dying</i> from the user perspective<br>
	(whole <i>Life Gauge behavior</i> list is in <a href="./blog/tdd-health/part2">Part 2</a>):
</p>
<ul class='list'>
	<li>Whenever Link takes damage he will lose a certain amount of Heart fractions<br>
		equal to the damage points taken (always losing at least 1 fraction)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Let's filter and transform this into a requirement that's focused only on the domain (as GUI will be done later):
</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Avatar will lose Health <code>CurrentPoints</code> equal to Damage Points taken (always losing at last 1 Health Point)</li>
</ul>

<h2>TDD cycling Taking Damage</h2>

<h3><span class="redFail">RED</span></h3>
<p>
	I start by writing the test.<br>
	The domain model focus will be a new method named <code>TakeDamage</code>,<br>
	Thus the write a nested test class with same name at the bottom<br>
	and within it write the test case <code>CurrentPointsDecrease</code> (I elaborate on my naming convention in <a href="./blog/tdd-health/part3">Part 3</a>)<br>
	that fails as the code does not compile (<code>TakeDamage</code> not yet written).
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="test_1_Red"></code></pre>
<p>
	Just to test not always the same starting value, I use <code>11</code> here (instead of <code>12</code>).
</p>

<h3><span class="greenPass">GREEN</span> -> <span class="greenRefactor">REFACTOR</span></h3>
<p>Let's make the test pass with a simple implementation of <code>TakeDamage</code>.
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="impl_1_Green"></code></pre>
<p>
	The implementation was easy to come up with,<br>and I'm also confident that it's the proper generic solution for this requirement,<br>
	A.K.A I did both <span class="greenPass">GREEN</span> and <span class="greenRefactor">REFACTOR</span> in one step for this implementation.<br>
	I feel that no further refactoring is needed in this cycle,<br>
	but I notice that invalid values can be passed in for <code>damagePoints</code> parameter.
</p>

<h2>Handle invalid <span class="code">damagePoints</span> values</h2>

<h3><span class="redFail">RED</span></h3>
<p>
	I start by writing the test.<br>
	It will be similar test to the existing <code>ThrowsError_</code> test but now the <i>entry point</i> is method <code>TakeDamage</code>,<br>
	and thus it will be under nested class <code>TakeDamage</code>
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="test_2_Red"></code></pre>
<p>
	The number I pass into the constructor does not matter to the test case, and thus is not a <i>TestCase</i> parameter.
</p>

<h3><span class="greenPass">GREEN</span></h3>
<p>Let's make the test pass with a simple implementation.<br>
	I duplicate the Exception throwing from the constructor and simply fix the parameter to <code>damagePoints</code>.
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="impl_2_Green"></code></pre>

<h3><span class="greenRefactor">REFACTOR</span></h3>
<p>
	Now the implementation code is starting to smell, as I duplicated a chunk of code to simply make the test pass.<br>
	(I also now notice that the hardcoded <code>0</code> in the message is not nice<br>
	as it potentially later could get out of sync with the condition).<br>
	Thus I refactor, and run all the tests as needed during it, to verify I haven't broken anything.<br>
	After some time the implementation looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="impl_2_Refactor"></code></pre>
<p>
	This is more like it, now the code feels clean.<br>
	<br>
	I verify with my eyes the message is proper of the thrown exception,<br>
	e.g if value <code>0</code> is passed in for <code>damagePoints</code>, the message is:<br>
	<code>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException : Value '0' is invalid, it should be equal or higher than '1'<br>
Parameter name: damagePoints</code><br>
	<br>
	I do this by temporarily commenting out the code of <code>ThrowsError_WhenDamagePointsIsInvalid</code> test case,<br>
	only leaving <code [highlight]="'var health = new Health(12);'"></code><br>
	then I run the test, see it fail, and then select the failed case where <code>0</code> was sent,<br>
	and read the message from the stacktrace below.<br>
	Afterwards I undo my commenting out in the test case.<br>
	I feel that manually testing this with my eyes is sufficient<br>
	(alternatively I could unit test and assert that the message includes certain key words).<br>
	<br>
	I run the tests in the end to verify everything works.<br>
	Below is the whole <code>HealthTest.cs</code>, along showing last run in the Test Runner:
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="test_final"></code></pre>

<h2>Concluding this part</h2>

<p>This concludes these requirements and this part.<br>
	The code with Unity project is in this <a href="https://github.com/EgillAntonsson/tdd-avatar-health/commit/9b1bffb35bf16a57ac613c50cb2fc6f49cdcd9b1">GitHub repo</a><br>
	I aim to continue with the requirements and the implementation in later blog posts.
