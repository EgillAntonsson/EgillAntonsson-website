<h2>The first <i>Taking damage</i> requirement</h2>
<p>
	Let's recap the first requirement under <i>Taking Damage</i> from the user perspective:
</p>
<ul class='list'>
	<li class="noBulletinPoint"><b>Taking Damage</b></li>
	<li>Whenever Link takes damage he will lose a certain amount of Heart fractions<br>
		equal to the damage points taken (always losing at least 1 fraction)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Let's filter and transform this into a requirement that's focused only on the domain (as GUI will be done later):
</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Avatar will lose Health <code>CurrentPoints</code> equal to Damage Points taken (always losing at last 1 Health Point)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taking Damage</h2>

<h3><span class="redFail">RED</span></h3>
<p>
	I start by writing the test.<br>
	The domain model focus will be a new method named <code>TakeDamage</code>,<br>
	Thus the write a nested test class with same name at the bottom<br>
	and within it write the test case <code>CurrentPointsDecrease</code> (I elaborate on my naming convention in <a href="./blog/tdd-health/part3">Part 3</a>)<br>
	that fails as the code does not compile (<code>TakeDamage</code> not yet written).
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="test_1_Red"></code></pre>
<p>
	Just to test not always the same starting value, I use <code>11</code> here (instead of <code>12</code>).
</p>

<h3><span class="greenPass">GREEN</span> -> <span class="greenRefactor">REFACTOR</span></h3>
<p>Let's make the test pass with a simple implementation of <code>TakeDamage</code>.
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="impl_1_Green"></code></pre>
<p>
	The implementation was easy to come up with,<br>and I'm also confident that it's the proper generic solution for this requirement,<br>
	A.K.A I did both <span class="greenPass">GREEN</span> and <span class="greenRefactor">REFACTOR</span> in one step for this implementation.<br>
	I feel that no further refactoring is needed in this cycle,<br>
	but I notice that invalid values can be passed in for <code>damagePoints</code> parameter.
</p>

<h2>Handle invalid <span class="code">damagePoints</span> values</h2>

<h3><span class="redFail">RED</span></h3>
<p>
	I start by writing the test.<br>
	It will be similar test to the existing <code>ThrowsError_</code> test but now the <i>entry point</i> is method <code>TakeDamage</code>.<br>
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="test_2_Red"></code></pre>
<p>
	The number I pass into the constructor does not matter to the test case, and thus is not a <i>TestCase</i> parameter.
</p>

<h3><span class="greenPass">GREEN</span></h3>
<p>Let's make the test pass with a simple implementation.<br>
	I duplicate the Exception throwing from the constructor and simply fix the parameter to <code>damagePoints</code>.
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="impl_2_Green"></code></pre>

<h3><span class="greenRefactor">REFACTOR</span></h3>
<p>
	Now the implementation code is starting to smell (as I duplicated code to simply make the test pass)<br>
	Thus i refactor, and run all test as needed during
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="impl_2_Refactor"></code></pre>
<p>
	Now this is more like it, now the code feels clean.<br>
	I run the tests in the end to verify everything works.

<h2>Concluding this part</h2>

<p>This concludes these requirements and this part.<br>
	The code with Unity project is in this <a href="https://github.com/EgillAntonsson/tdd-avatar-health/commit/9b1bffb35bf16a57ac613c50cb2fc6f49cdcd9b1">GitHub repo</a><br>
	I aim to continue with the requirements and the implementation in later blog posts.
