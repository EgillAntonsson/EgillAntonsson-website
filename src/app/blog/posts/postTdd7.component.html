<h2>The requirement</h2>
<p>
	Let's recap this requirement from the user perspective:
</p>

<ul class="list">
	<li>The Life Gauge can be increased by 1 full Heart at a time,<br>
		up to a maximum of 30 Hearts</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Example of case when Life Gauge is not full when the increase is executed:<br>
</p>
<ul class="list inline">
	<li>Before increase: 1 Fraction filled of total 3 Hearts</li>
	<li>After increase: 1 Hearth + 1 Fraction filled of total 4 Hearts</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In <i>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> this is a big gameplay event<br>
	and thus the increase is always 1 full Heart each time and no more.
</p>
<div [innerHTML]="completeRequirementListHtml"></div>

<p>
	{{rewordRequirement}}
</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li><code>FullPoints</code> and <code>CurrentPoints</code> can be increased simultaneously<br>
		by 4 <code>Points</code> at a time,<br>
		up to a maximum of 120 <code>Points</code><br>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Now it makes sense to define a new unit in <code>Health</code> that equals 4 <code>Points,</code><br>
	(that is visually represented as a Heart or something else),<br>
	as the increase should always be in that unit.<br>
</p>
<h3>Domain / Visual SoC mapping, revisited</h3>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Domain Model</th>
		<th>GUI / View</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center">
			(Avatar) Health
		</td>
		<td class="center">
			Life Gauge
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center">
				<b><i>Unit</i></b>
		</td>
		<td class="center">
			Heart (holds 4 Fractions)
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center">
			Points
		</td>
		<td class="center">
			Heart Fractions
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	I add a new domain definition <i>Unit</i> that maps to the visualized <i>Heart</i><br>
	now let's reword the requirement again:<br>
</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li><code>FullPoints</code> and <code>CurrentPoints</code> can be increased simultaneously<br>
		by 1 <code>Unit</code> at a time,<br>
		up to a maximum of 30 <code>Units</code><br>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	It's also nice that using <code>Units</code> makes the numbers smaller (e.g 120 -> 30)
</p>

<div [innerHTML]="aboutCodeHtml"></div>

<h2>Entry point <code>IncreaseByUnit</code></h2>
<p>
	The domain model focus will be a new method named <code>IncreaseByUnit</code>.<br>
</p>

<h2>Exit point <code>FullPoints</code></h2>
<p>
	Focusing first on the existing <code>FullPoints</code> property.
</p>
<h3><span class="redFail">RED</span></h3>

<pre><code [highlight]="red_increaseByUnit_fullPointsIncrease"></code></pre>

<h3><span class="greenPass">GREEN</span></h3>
<p>
	I make the test pass with an effortless implementation.
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="green_increaseByUnit_fullPointsIncrease"></code></pre>
<p>
	I don't like that the 'magic' number <code>4</code> does not explain<br>
	the relationship between <code>Points</code> and <code>Unit</code>.<br>
	Thus I refactor it.
</p>

<h3><span class="greenRefactor">REFACTOR</span></h3>

<pre><code [highlight]="refactor_increaseByUnit_fullPointsIncrease"></code></pre>
<p>
	Now it's replaced with a meaningfully named constant member<br>
	that defines and documents well this relationship (in the code itself).<br>
</p>

<h2>Exit point <code>CurrentPoints</code></h2>
<p>
	Now I focus on the other <i>exit point</i>, the existing <code>CurrentPoints</code> property.<br>
	It should have new tests as it's about a different <i>exit point</i><br>
	(see Good Unit Test definition in <a href="./blog/tdd-health/part1">part 1</a>).
</p>

<h3><span class="redFail">RED</span></h3>

<pre><code [highlight]="red_increaseByUnit_currentPointsIncrease"></code></pre>

<h3><span class="greenPass">GREEN</span></h3>

<pre><code [highlight]="green_increaseByUnit_currentPointsIncrease"></code></pre>
<p>
	I effortlessly add the line <code>CurrentPoints = FullPoints</code>,<br>
	which is enough to make the test pass,<br>
	but I know that it only holds for this particular case, and not for others.<br>
	Thus I'll cycle the other cases.
</p>

<h3><span class="redFail">RED</span></h3>
<pre><code [highlight]="red_increaseByUnit_currentPoints_moreCases"></code></pre>
<p>
	For readability, I select <code>4</code> for the <code>startingPoints</code> parameter value,<br>
	which also keeps the other numbers low.
</p>

<h3><span class="greenPass">GREEN</span></h3>

<pre><code [highlight]="green_increaseByUnit_currentPoints_moreCases"></code></pre>
<p>
	I could have taken a bigger step in the previous <span class="greenPass">GREEN</span> step<br>
	and come straight away with this generic solution,<br>
	but both paths should lead to the same result (both solution and tests),<br>
	the path presented here makes the tests drive the implementation.
</p>

<h2>Maximum</h2>
<p>
	All that is left of the requirement is the maximum part.<br>
	The game will only give the user the option to spend resources<br>
	to increase the health if the maximum <code>FullPoints</code> has not been reached.
	Thus the outside code will query <code>Health</code> if maximum has been reached<br>
	and only invoke <code>IncreaseByUnit</code> if not.
</p>

<h3><span class="redFail">RED</span></h3>
<p>
	The domain model focus will be a new property named <code>IsMaxFullPointsReached</code>.<br>
</p>

<pre><code [highlight]="red_IsMaxFullPointsReached"></code></pre>
<p>
	I'm presenting a bigger step, adding 2 test at the same time,<br>
	(thus skipping the smaller cycles I did within it).<br>
	It uses a new constant <code>MaxFullPoints</code>,<br>
	and the test has two compile errors as both<br>
	<code>MaxFullPoints</code> and <code>IsMaxFullPointsReached</code> are not defined.
</p>

<h3><span class="greenPass">GREEN</span></h3>
<pre><code [highlight]="green_IsMaxFullPointsReached"></code></pre>
<p>
	I define the constant <code>MaxFullPoints</code> and give it the proper value.<br>
	I implement the read-only property as an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members">Expression-Bodied Member</a>.<br>
	<br>
	I should make method <code>IncreaseByUnit</code> throw error if max has been reached,<br>
	to protect the state of <code>Health</code> from improper usage,<br>
	i.e. if the outside code invokes <code>IncreaseByUnit</code> when <code>IsMaxFullPointsReached</code> is <code>true</code>.
</p>

<h3><span class="redFail">RED</span></h3>
<pre><code [highlight]="red_IncreaseByUnit_ThrowsError"></code></pre>
<p>
	I deem I can use existing <code>InvalidOperationException</code> from <code>System</code><br>
	if I include an informative message for my case.<br>
	I assert that the message contains "invalid",<br>
	intentionally not being more specific<br>
	so the assert does not fail later because of potential rewording.
</p>

<h3><span class="greenPass">GREEN</span></h3>
<pre><code [highlight]="green_IncreaseByUnit_ThrowsError"></code></pre>
<p>
	I pass the test by adding the <i>if</i> condition at the start of the method.<br>
	<br>
	Now the requirement has been fulfilled and the Unity Test Runner looks like this:
</p>
